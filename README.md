Technology Stack: The project is developed using the Python Flask framework along with the Flask-SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL libraries to manage the MySQL database.

Essential Web Pages: It includes a complete website structure with Home, About, Services, and Contact Us pages.

Six Field Registration: The registration system captures at least six user input fields—Username, Password, Full Name, Email, Phone, and City—and stores them securely in the database.

Secure Authentication: The system verifies user credentials and redirects successful logins to a private dashboard.

Security Lockout Mechanism: Any account that fails to login five times is automatically locked for 30 minutes to ensure security.

Administrative User List: A separate administration page allows for the viewing of all registered user information in a table format.

Search and Delete Functionality: Admins can search for specific users by their ID and have the option to permanently delete records from the database.

Live Demonstration: I have successfully demonstrated this project by running it during the second slot in Lab 1 of Block E.
